# 🧠 Memory Architect
### *Build the Neural City of Tomorrow*

> **What if memories were physical resources you could collect, store, and distribute?**

Welcome to Memory Architect - a mind-bending city management game where you're the architect of a neural metropolis! Your citizens don't need food or water... they need **memories** to survive and thrive.

## 🎮 The Concept

In this cyberpunk-inspired world, you manage a city where:
- **Buildings are giant memory banks** that store different types of human experiences
- **Citizens are living souls** who wander the city seeking specific memories to feel fulfilled
- **Your job** is to collect, preserve, and distribute memories before they decay

## 🌈 Six Types of Memories

Each memory type has its own unique properties and visual style:

| Memory Type | Icon | Purpose | Color |
|-------------|------|---------|-------|
| **Love** 💖 | Pink Radiance | Emotional connections | Hot Pink |
| **Knowledge** 📚 | Blue Wisdom | Learning & growth | Royal Blue |
| **Adventure** 🗺️ | Orange Energy | Thrills & exploration | Bright Orange |
| **Peace** 🕊️ | Green Serenity | Calm & meditation | Soft Green |
| **Nostalgia** 🌅 | Purple Dreams | Past experiences | Lavender |
| **Courage** ⚔️ | Red Power | Bravery & strength | Crimson |
